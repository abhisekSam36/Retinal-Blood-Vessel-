Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation
This project provides a deep learning pipeline for segmenting blood vessels in retinal fundus images using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes implementations of the U-Net and LadderNet architectures, along with preprocessing scripts and a framework for training and testing on public datasets.

Segmentation Results

The figure below shows sample segmentation results from the original paper on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets.
Example results from the paper (a) Original Image (b) Ground Truth (c) U-Net Prediction (d) LadderNet Prediction.

Key Features
Two Architectures: Implements both U-Net and LadderNet for vessel segmentation.

Multiple Datasets: Supports the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 public datasets.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes a pipeline for converting images to grayscale, performing CLAHE enhancement, and gamma correction to improve vessel visibility.

Patch-Based Training: Uses a patch extraction strategy to handle high-resolution images efficiently.

Modern Environment: Updated to run on modern Python with TensorFlow 2, including support for Apple Silicon GPUs.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

macOS or Linux

Python 3.9+

Homebrew (for macOS users, to install Graphviz)

Git and Git Large File Storage (LFS)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub. The git lfs pull command is essential to download the large .hdf5 dataset files.

Bash
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_FOLDER>
git lfs pull
Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages. This command is tailored for macOS with Apple Silicon.

Bash
# Install Python packages
pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal opencv-python pillow h5py scikit-learn matplotlib pydot

# Install Graphviz system dependency (for plotting model architecture)
brew install graphviz
Usage Workflow
Step 1: Download Raw Datasets

Manually download the raw images for the desired datasets (e.g., DRIVE) and place them in the project folder according to the structure expected by the preparation scripts (e.g., ./DRIVE/training/images/).

Step 2: Prepare Datasets

Run the corresponding script to convert the raw images into the .hdf5 format required for training.

Bash
# Example for the DRIVE dataset
python prepare_datasets_DRIVE.py
Step 3: Configure Experiment

Before training, edit the appropriate configuration file (e.g., configuration_drive.txt). It is highly recommended to set a unique name for each experiment to save results in a separate folder.

Ini, TOML
[experiment name]
name = my_first_gnet_experiment
Step 4: Run Training

Launch the training process using the run_training.py script and your chosen configuration file.

Bash
python run_training.py configuration_drive.txt
Step 5: Run Testing

After training is complete, evaluate the model on the test set.

Bash
python run_testing.py configuration_drive.txt
The results, including predicted images and a performances.txt file with metrics, will be saved in your experiment folder.

Experimenting
You can easily experiment with different models and settings:

Switching Models: To switch between U-Net and LadderNet, simply change the function call from model = get_gnet(...) to model = get_unet(...) in the src/retina_unet_training.py file.

Changing Hyperparameters: Adjust settings like the number of epochs (N_epochs), batch size (batch_size), and number of patches (N_subimgs) in the configuration files to see how they affect performance.
